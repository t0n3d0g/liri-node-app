# liri-node-app

## What the project does
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Why the project is useful
LIRI provides 3 types of useful information.
  * Given an artist, it provides information on upcoming concert dates.
  * Given a song, it provides information on the song's performer, album and preview of the song.
  * Given a movie, it provides information about the movie's plot, cast, etc.

## How users can get started with the project
This is node-based application which must be run from the command line.
To use the concert function, type:
  
  *Example: liri.js concert-this Gary Clark Jr.*
  
To use the song function, type:
  
  *Example: liri.js spotify-this-song Hello*
  
To use the movie function, type:
  
  *Example: node liri.js movie-this 2001*
